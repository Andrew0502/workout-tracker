## Description
  The Workout tracker is a means of keeping track of workouts you perform and then displaying them in a graph. The homework focused on building the back end. The model and controller were built from scratch to make the app function. It uses MongoDB to keep track of the data, and this is much easier than with SQL and sequlize that requires a far more structured database.
